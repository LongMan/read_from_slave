Read_from_slave

Read_from_slave for Rails enables database reads from a slave database, while writes continue to go to the master

Read_from_slave will work with Rails 2.2 and above.

Installation

sudo gem install sdsykes-read_from_slave

Configuration

In config/environments/production.rb (for instance)

  config.gem "sdsykes-read_from_slave", :lib=>"read_from_slave"

In config/database.yml

  production:
    adapter: mysql
    database: mydatabase
    username: myuser
    password: mypassword
    host: my.main.database.server.com
    port: 3306

  slave_for_mydatabase:
    adapter: mysql
    database: mydatabase
    username: myuser
    password: mypassword
    socket: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

Just use the regular YAML format to specify your slave database, it could equally well be on
another server as the local example given above.

Phusion Passenger

Note if you are using Passenger, you need to make sure that the slave database is reconnected
if there is any chance that it was accessed before the spawner forks.  In my case it is because
I access the database during the construction of routes.

The safest thing to do is to have something like this in your production.rb or environment.rb:

  PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
    if forked
      # We're in smart spawning mode.                                                               
      ActiveRecord::Base.establish_slave_connections
    else
      # We're in conservative spawning mode. We don't need to do anything.                          
    end
  end
